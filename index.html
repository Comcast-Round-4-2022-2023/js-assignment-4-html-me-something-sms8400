      <p>My journey each year is take a magical drive. If you are in the Cape May area, this is something you should not miss!

         This is when Mother Nature really shines is when you watch the sunset on this beach. It is so graceful and beautiful that they should play music as it sets. Watching it over the horizon is just magnificent. The colors are so vibrant as it sets and sets the whole sky ablaze with colors spread across the beach.
         
         It is nice to just in the sand and watch it happen. It is getting busier on the beach too as more people come to see this wonderful site.</p>

      <h3>Graphic Design</h3>

      <!--paragraph about the .... -->
      <p id="testP">“I want to be a Graphic Designer for several reasons. The main reason is that I get to express myself creatively as a Graphic Designer. I love my work; I never get tired or bored of it, and I enjoy the fact that I must keep my work relevant to the demands of the commercial sector I am working in. Things change all the time, and to be a great Graphic Designer you must be current and stand out from everyone else. I also enjoy the freedom you get from being a Graphic Designer. If I get to work for you, you will be putting your trust in me to deliver great design work, and I will thrive on the challenge that brings. Finally, I want to be a Graphic Designer because of the variety the role brings. No two jobs are ever the same as a Graphic Designer, and you have to think carefully about the job you are working on, and you must push yourself to come up with new and innovative ideas to meet your brief.”</p>

      <h3>Photography      </h3>

      <!--paragraph about first activity-->
      <p class="funParagraph">Let’s face it: Life can get pretty hectic sometimes. Whether you’re juggling a demanding job, dealing with family responsibilities, or simply navigating the ups and downs of daily life, stress seems to be a constant companion.

         But photography offers a unique escape, a chance to disconnect from the chaos and reconnect with your inner self. It’s a mindful practice that encourages you to be fully present in the moment. As you frame a shot, adjusting your focus and composing the elements just right, the rest of the world fades into the background. Your attention shifts to the details, the interplay of light and shadow, and the subtle nuances that make each scene come alive.</p>
